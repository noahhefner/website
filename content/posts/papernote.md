I've tried a lot of note taking applications. Ive used Google Keep, [Standard Notes](https://standardnotes.com/), [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/), and more recently, [Flatnotes](https://github.com/Dullage/flatnotes). All of these options (minus Google Keep) have a few common traits. They are all **self-hostable**, **open-source**, and **support markdown**. Going forward, any note taking application I use must support these three key features.

I've really enjoyed Flatnotes. It has one key feature that made me move away from Joplin: **plain markdown file storage**. Unlike Joplin which stores note data in an SQL database, Flatnotes reads and writes data directly to markdown files stored on the server. This makes it incredibly easy to move notes in and out of the server. There is nothing locking your notes into the application.

Flatnotes is not without its flaws though. I'm not a fan of the list view as it does not make efficient use of the users vertical screen real estate. The home screen - it's just a search bar, no list view of your notes. I tend to use my notes more for archival purposes
