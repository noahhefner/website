With each passing day, AI is finding new mediums to summarize. Copilot can now summarize your emails, YouTube can summarize the content of any video, Spotify Recap can summarize audiobook chapters, and Google will even summarize the internet for you with its AI Overview. These “AI summary” features seem to be invading every content consumption platform on the internet.

From the user’s perspective, these summaries can be incredibly useful. Why would I spend 30 minutes watching a video, reading an article, or browsing a dozen different websites when I can get everything I need from an AI summary? If all you need is information, then a summary of that information is often all you need. In the case of Google’s AI Overview, this presents a problem for some websites, since users are no longer actually visiting the site. Fewer site visitors means fewer advertisement views, which means less money for website owners. This is an obvious problem.

But I want to focus on a concept I believe to be far more troublesome. As users become more comfortable with AI summaries—and more confident in the accuracy of those summaries—they are interacting less and less with the source material. All the content we watch, read, and listen to is now being filtered through an AI lens.

Knowing this, let’s play out what the future of online content might look like. Let’s assume that AI summaries only become more widespread, invading every aspect of our digital lives. AI chatbots like ChatGPT and Gemini will, for some people, be the only way they access the internet and information. I’ll also assume that at some point in the future, AI companies will be forced to pay for the websites they scrape for information. While users may not view source content directly, at least the original authors will still receive a kickback for their work.

Under these assumptions, I think it’s reasonable to believe that content creators will seek ways to optimize their content for AI summaries. Instead of optimizing for search engines, content will be optimized for AI agents. What that will look like, I do not know.

Is it possible that AI kills the traditional website? Why would content creators invest time and money into building a website that will only be accessed by LLM web scrapers? I think it’s possible that the next generation of the internet adopts an LLM-first model, where websites don’t even bother to build polished user interfaces around their information. Instead, content could simply be published as some sort of plaintext index file, which an LLM then scrapes, summarizes, and delivers back to the user.

Now, you may think this only affects information-publishing sites such as news outlets, blogs, videos, or academic material. Surely interaction-heavy web applications like online retailers, banking apps, and email are safe, right? I beg to differ. LLMs are already invading those spaces too. For years, Amazon has allowed users to purchase items via Alexa devices just by speaking to them. For a more recent example, look no further than ChatGPT’s Instacart plugin. Instead of interacting directly with Instacart, an LLM can now purchase groceries on your behalf. Whether we like it or not, AI is finally becoming the “personal assistant” consumers were promised over a decade ago.

I believe it’s entirely possible that AI becomes a sort of “universal frontend” for almost every digital experience you can think of. Want to listen to music? Ask your AI. Want to order takeout? Ask your AI. Need to book a plane ticket? Have your AI watch airline prices and buy one when prices dip.

This could put many digital companies in a challenging position. How do you build a digital product or experience knowing that your primary “users” are computer programs? Perhaps more importantly, do you fight against this trend and try to build something that cannot be experienced through an AI, or do you give in and optimize your product for agents instead of humans?
