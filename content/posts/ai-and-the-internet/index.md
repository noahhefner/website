Search Agent Optimization


Ideas

With each passing day, AI is finding new mediums to summarize. Copilot can now summarize that three paragraph email from your coworker about the project you're working on. YouTube will happily provide an AI-generated summary of any video on their platform, meaning you don't have to watch a 30 minute video and sit through a baked-in ad read to get the information you need for a research paper. Even Spotify is using AI to generate summaries of previously listened audiobook chapters to help users pick up a story after a hiatus with a new feature called Recap.

These all sound like great ideas on paper. Why would I waste time engaging with a peice of content when I can get everything I need from the summary? These summaries are being marketed as time-saving tools and in many cases, they can actually be useful. (Spotify Recap sounds like a genuinely cool idea to me.) But there's a hidden side-effect here: AI is slowly but surely inserting itself as a middleman between users and content in every aspect of our lives.

Colin and Samir did a fantastic episode 

1. AI layer between users and content

    - there is now an additional AI layer between you and the content
    - With each passing day, we are being further separated from source material.
    - google ai overview
    - outlook summarize email
    - youtube summarize video
    - spotify summarize podcasts

2. Content creators optimizing for AI summarizers

    - colin and samir; the summarization of content. its not enough to just provide information. you have to provide tone, style, and perspective
    - content creators will optimize for attention of ai models
    - optimize for the summarize

3.  The Death of the Website   

    - could there be a future where "visiting websites" is a thing of the past? 
    - content publishers simply publish their work in some non-human readable format, optimized for ai agents 

4. AI as a universal frontend for everything

    - plugins for chatgpt where you can order groceries on instacart from app

5. Dangers of AI Summaries

    - ai generated news feeds with political bias
    -
