## The Summarization of Content

The summarization of content has become one of the most prominent and impactful use cases for artificial intelligence. For example, YouTube recently implemented a feature that can instantly generate a text summary of any video on the platform, allowing users to extract all the information from the video without actually watching it. Other platforms are implementing content summary features too. Microsoft Copilot can summarize your emails, Spotify Recap can summarize audiobook chapters, and Google will even summarize the entire internet for you with AI Overview. These “AI summary” features seem to be invading every content consumption platform on the internet.

People are interacting less and less with source material as they grow more accustomed to and accepting of AI-generated summaries. Many folks are simply asking LLMs for answers to all their questions, skipping the search engine entirely. The information we watch, read, and listen to is increasingly being filtered through an AI lens.

Knowing this, let’s play out what the future of online content might look like. Let’s assume that AI summaries and chat bots only become more widespread, invading every aspect of our digital lives. For some people, LLMs will be the primary avenue by which they access the internet and information. Informational sites like news outlets, blogging platforms, and academic resources will be all but abondoned by actual humans, being accessed primarily by web scrapers to feed the ever so data hungry LLMs.

In this future, think it’s reasonable to believe that content creators will seek ways to optimize their material not for humans, but for AI summarization tools. Creators will publish their content in such a way that the AI model cites their material instead of of others; that is, if the AI bothers to cite its sources at all.

## The Death of Web Surfing?

Is it possible that AI kills "surfing the web"? Why would anyone invest time and money into a product that will only be accessed by an AI agent? I think it’s possible that the next generation of the internet adopts an LLM-first model, where websites don’t even bother to build polished user interfaces around their content. Instead, content could simply be published as some sort of plaintext index file, which an LLM then scrapes, summarizes, and delivers back to the user.

But surely interaction-heavy web applications like online retailers, banking apps, and email are safe from the AI scraper problem, right? I beg to differ. LLMs are already invading those spaces too. For years, Amazon has allowed users to purchase items via Alexa devices just by speaking to them. And that was long before the current AI boom! For a more recent example, look no further than ChatGPT’s Instacart plugin. Instead of interacting directly with Instacart, an LLM can now purchase groceries on your behalf. Whether we like it or not, AI is finally becoming the “personal assistant” consumers were promised over a decade ago.

I believe it’s entirely possible that AI becomes a sort of “universal frontend” for almost every digital experience you can think of. Want to listen to music? Ask your AI. Want to order takeout? Ask your AI. Need to book a plane ticket? Have your AI watch airline prices and buy one when prices dip.

This could put many digital companies in a challenging position. How do you build a digital product or experience knowing that your primary “users” are computer programs? Do you buck against this trend and try to build a human-first experience that cannot be fully appreciated through an AI, or do you play along and optimize your product for AI agents instead of humans? 

I have no idea what the answer to that question is. But one thing is for certain: tech companies are doing everything in their power to wedge an AI product between you and the rest of the digital world. It is ultimately up to the consumer whether this trend will continue.
