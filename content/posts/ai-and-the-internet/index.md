## AI and the Summarization of Content

The [summarization of content](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/62FryBYrZzA) has become one of the most prominent and impactful applications of artificial intelligence. YouTube recently introduced a feature that instantly generates a text summary of any video on the platform, enabling users to extract all the information from a video without needing to watch it. Other platforms are implementing content summary features as well. Microsoft Copilot can summarize your emails, [Spotify Recap](https://newsroom.spotify.com/2025-11-13/audiobook-recaps-beta-test/) can summarize audiobook chapters, and Google will even summarize the entire internet for you with AI Overviews. These “AI summary” features seem to be invading every content consumption platform on the internet.

People are interacting less and less with source material as they grow more accustomed to — and accepting of — AI-generated summaries. Why would I spend my valuable time watching a 30-minute video or perusing a dozen different websites when I can get the same information from an AI-generated summary? Many folks are turning to these summaries and chatbots for answers to all their questions, skipping the search engine entirely. As a result, the information we watch, read, and listen to is increasingly being filtered through an AI lens.

With this in mind, let’s play out what the future of online content might look like. Let’s assume that AI summaries and chatbots only become more widespread, invading every aspect of our digital lives. For some people, large language models (LLMs) will be the primary interface through which they access the internet. Informational sites like news outlets, blogging platforms, and academic resources will be all but abandoned by actual humans, accessed primarily by web scrapers to feed data-hungry AI models.

In this future, I think it’s reasonable to believe that content creators will seek ways to optimize their material not for humans, but for AI summarization. Creators will publish their content in such a way that AI models cite their material instead of others — that is, if the AI bothers to cite its sources at all. Search engine optimization will be replaced by search **agent** optimization. Websites will no longer be built to climb search rankings; they will be engineered to win the “recommendation” of the AI agents that now gatekeep the web.

## The Death of Web Surfing?

Could AI kill “web surfing”? The next generation of the internet could adopt an "AI-first" architecture, where digital service providers don’t even bother building polished user interfaces around their content. Instead, content could simply be published as some sort of plaintext index file, which an LLM then scrapes, summarizes, and delivers back to the user.

But surely interaction-heavy web applications like online retailers, banking apps, and email are safe from AI agents, right? I beg to differ. LLMs are already invading those spaces too. For years, Amazon has allowed users to purchase items via Alexa devices simply by speaking to them — and that was long before the current AI boom. For a more recent example, look no further than ChatGPT’s Instacart plugin. Instead of interacting directly with Instacart, an LLM can now purchase groceries on your behalf. Whether we like it or not, AI is actually becoming the “personal assistant” consumers were [promised more than a decade ago](https://www.cnn.com/2011/10/04/tech/mobile/siri-iphone-4s-skynet).

I believe it’s entirely possible that AI becomes a sort of “universal frontend” for almost every digital experience you can think of. Want to listen to music? Ask your AI. Want to order takeout? Ask your AI. Need to book a plane ticket? Have your AI watch airline prices and buy one when prices dip. As AI agents become increasingly capable, the need for direct interaction with traditional digital applications may effectively vanish.

This shift could put many tech companies in a challenging position. How do you build a digital product or experience knowing that your primary “users” are computer programs? Industry leaders will face a difficult decision: do you resist this trend and try to build a human-first experience that cannot be fully appreciated through AI, or do you jump on the hype train and optimize your product for AI agents instead of humans?

## Conclusion

In my personal opinion, delegating our everyday tasks to AI agents constitutes a quiet forfeiture of human autonomy. As our digital assistants take on more responsibilities, they slowly become less like assistants and more like gatekeepers. I’m not trying to be an AI doomer; I simply hope that AI advances in a way that preserves the freedoms of the individual. AI should be viewed as a tool for “improving health outcomes, education outcomes, public sector efficiency, and private sector competitiveness,” to [quote Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella](https://www.businessworld.in/article/microsoft-ceo-nadella-defines-ai-bubble-risk-at-wef-davos-2026-589972) from this year’s World Economic Forum. Because without that, “this [AI] makes no sense.”
