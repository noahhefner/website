Search Agent Optimization


Ideas

With each passing day, AI is finding new mediums to summarize. Copilot can now summarize your emails, YouTube can summarize the content of any video, Spotify Recap can summarize audiobook chapters, and Google will even summarize the internet for you with its AI Overview. These "AI summary" features seem to be invading every content consuption platform on the internet.

From the user's perspective, these summaries can be incredibly useful. Why would I spend 30 minutes wathcing a video, reading an article, or browsing a dozen different websites when I can get everything I need from the AI summary? If all you need is information, then a summary of that information is often all you need. In the case of Google's AI Overview, this presents a problem for some websites since users are no longer actually visiting the site. Less site visitors means less advertisement views which means less money for website owners. This is an obvious problem.

But I want to focus on a concept I believe to be far more troublesome. As users become more comfortable with AI summaries and more condifent in the accuracy of said summaries, they are interracting less and less with the source material. All the content we watch, read, and listen to is now being filtered through an AI lense.

Knowing this, let's play out what the future of online content might look like. Let's assume that AI summaries will only become more widespread, invading every aspect of our digital lives. AI chatbots like ChatGPT and Gemini will for some people be the only way they access the internet and information. I will also assume that at some point in the future, AI companies will be forced to pay for the websites that they scrape for information. While users may not view source content directly, at least the original authors will still recieve a kickback for their work.

Under these assumptions, I think it's reasonable to assume that content creators will seek ways to optimize their content for these AI summaries. Instead of optimizing for search engines, content will be optimized for AI agents. What that will look like, I do now know.

Is it possible that AI kills the traditional website? 


1. AI layer between users and content

    - there is now an additional AI layer between you and the content
    - With each passing day, we are being further separated from source material.
    - google ai overview
    - outlook summarize email
    - youtube summarize video
    - spotify summarize podcasts

2. Content creators optimizing for AI summarizers

    - colin and samir; the summarization of content. its not enough to just provide information. you have to provide tone, style, and perspective
    - content creators will optimize for attention of ai models
    - optimize for the summarize

3.  The Death of the Website   

    - could there be a future where "visiting websites" is a thing of the past? 
    - content publishers simply publish their work in some non-human readable format, optimized for ai agents 

4. AI as a universal frontend for everything

    - plugins for chatgpt where you can order groceries on instacart from app

5. Dangers of AI Summaries

    - ai generated news feeds with political bias
    - 




In an episode titled "The Creator Economy's Abundance Crisis" from The Colin and Samir Show, Colin and Samir talk at length about how AI summaries will affect content creators. The crux of their take is that as a video creator specifically, it is no longer good enough to simply provide information to the viewer. To be successful on YouTube in the AI era, you have to provide a unique "tone, style, and perspective" in your video that can't be communicated through an AI summary. In other words, make content that can't be summarized.
