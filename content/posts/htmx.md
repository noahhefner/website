Earlier this year, I started side project called Papernote. It is a note-taking applicaiton that runs in the browser. Like most of my side-projects, the actual product was more of a side-quest--I just wanted an excuse to learn some new tools. Since this was a web-app, I had to decide on what "frontend framework" to use. I had used React and Vue in the past for other things, so those were no-go's. I had been hearing a lot about a Javascript library called HTMX, so having no idea what I was getting myself into, I decided to give it a shot.

At this point in my career, I knew basically nothing about web development. My experience with Javascript frameworks was limited to college assignments and half-baked side projects. Everything I knew about frontend web developement was learned from YouTube tutorials, Stack Overflow posts, and Udemy courses. Take my college capstone project for example. It was a system for managing band uniform inventory for a local high school. We built the frontend in React and used Express on the server. We used MongoDB Atlas as our database and deployed it with Heroku. It was actually a pretty solid application, yet *I had no idea how it worked under the hood*. 

I started learning HTMX with the official HTMX textbook, Hypermedia Systems.
