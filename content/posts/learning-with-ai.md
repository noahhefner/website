I recently put out an article on my note-taking application side-project, [Papernote](https://github.com/noahhefner/papernote). This might be the first time I started a side project and actually saw it through to the minimum viable product (MVP) state. In prior side-projects, I would usually lose interest in the original idea or run into some technical issue that I could not solve and give up. This time was different though, and I atrribute that in large part to ChatGPT.

Prior to working on Papernote, I had very limited frontend experience. College projects in React and other small personal projects in Vue.js were the extent of it. I am by no means a frontend web developer. I found ChatGPT to be super helpful for writing HTML and expecially CSS. It supercharged my frontend knowledge and allowed me to crank out code way faster than I would have overwise. With the latest wave of AI hype, this got me thinking more broadly about the role of AI in the developement cycle and how it can be best utilized both in a learning context and in the workplace.


# Ideas

## AI in Education

- That initial learning curve where you try, fail, repeat is crucial. if you skip that phase, you miss out on understanding the code you are writing
- but maybe old people would say the same thing about me and having internet access. in the same way that the internet greatly reduced the time it took to troubleshoot and debug, chatbots also greatly reduced the time it takes to troubleshoot and debug code. but already in educational institutions, we encourage students not to look up the answer on stack overflow / google before attempting to solve the problem. the whole point of leetcode is to develop your programming problem solving skills without using the internet. chatgpt is like stack overflow on steroids. use it when you need it, use it as a tool, do not use it as a crutch.

## AI as a learning tool
- AI is simply a better google
- allowed me to develop faster
- inspired me to work on side projects more
- helped me learn a lot about web development, docker
- there is still no shortcuts to learning, but ai can help you learn faster
- you still have to know stuff tho, sometimes it will give you a code suggestion that may technically work, but is not good practice or not the right implementation for your project (try to find an example of this)
