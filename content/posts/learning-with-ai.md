Over the past few months, I've been working on web-based note taking application as a side project. I chose Golang and HTMX as the core tooling for the project, simply because I wanted to learn Golang and HTMX is popular in web development spheres at the moment. I had a tiny bit of frontend experience from college projects and other small personal projects prior to starting this project, but zero experience in Golang. 

Like many software developers, I have always struggled to follow through on my side projects. My Github repository was once full of repositories with a single commit made 4 years ago, never to see the light of day again. (I've since cleaned house and deleted many of them.)

## AI in Education

- That initial learning curve where you try, fail, repeat is crucial. if you skip that phase, you miss out on understanding the code you are writing
- but maybe old people would say the same thing about me and having internet access. in the same way that the internet greatly reduced the time it took to troubleshoot and debug, chatbots also greatly reduced the time it takes to troubleshoot and debug code. but already in educational institutions, we encourage students not to look up the answer on stack overflow / google before attempting to solve the problem. the whole point of leetcode is to develop your programming problem solving skills without using the internet. chatgpt is like stack overflow on steroids. use it when you need it, use it as a tool, do not use it as a crutch.

## AI as a learning tool
- AI is simply a better google
- allowed me to develop faster
- inspired me to work on side projects more
- helped me learn a lot about web development, docker
- you still have to know stuff tho, sometimes it will give you a code suggestion that may technically work, but is not good practice or not the right implementation for your project (try to find an example of this)
